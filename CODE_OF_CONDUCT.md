## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being respectful** of differing viewpoints and experiences
- **Gracefully accepting** constructive criticism
- **Focusing on what is best** for the community
- **Showing empathy** towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Spamming or excessive self-promotion
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
- Comments
- Commits
- Code
- Wiki edits
- Issues
- Other contributions

That are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Participating in project-related discussions

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

- Opening a GitHub issue with the `conduct` label
- Contacting the project maintainers directly
- Using GitHub's report abuse feature

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
